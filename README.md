In this repository the Python notebooks, R-Scrips and Rmarkdown reports are provided. Scripts follow the outlined order:

## Isoseq data analysis
TBA

## iCLIP data analysis

* 1 Binding site definition
  * Compute 5nt wide SF3B1 binding sites based on intial crosslink sites and iCLIP coverage
* 2 Binding site classification
  * Classify binding sites in of three bins according to their distance pattern
* 3 Coverage profile analysis
  * Compare SF3B1 and U2AF2 binding signals at selected genomic landmarks by direct coverage plots
* 4 Differential binding analysis
   * Analyse the binding site specific differences between the SF3B1 wt and mut condition

## Integration of isoseq and iCLIP

* 1 Splicing maps
  * Compute iCLIP binding maps across regulated 3'SS
* 2 Regulatory patterns
  * Analyse features of regulated and putative alternative 3'SS
